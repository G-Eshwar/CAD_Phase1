#Disaster Recovery with IBM Cloud Virtual Server

Welcome to the Disaster Recovery project! This project focuses on implementing a robust disaster recovery plan using IBM Cloud Virtual Server. It aims to ensure the continuity of critical business operations in the event of unforeseen disasters or service disruptions. By leveraging IBM Cloud Virtual Server, you can achieve a reliable and scalable disaster recovery solution.

 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to establish a comprehensive disaster recovery plan that guarantees the availability and integrity of essential data and services during unexpected incidents. Key goals include:

 Implementing failover mechanisms to maintain service continuity.
 Ensuring data backup and recovery processes are efficient and secure.
 Leveraging the scalability and reliability of IBM Cloud Virtual Server.
 Minimizing downtime and service disruptions to maintain business operations.

Design Thinking Process

This disaster recovery project adheres to a structured design thinking process, which involves the following phases:

1. Risk Assessment: Identifying potential disaster scenarios, evaluating their impact, and assessing the criticality of systems and data.

2. Architecture Design: Creating a disaster recovery architecture that includes backup solutions, failover mechanisms, and cloud infrastructure setup.

3. IBM Cloud Configuration: Configuring the necessary resources, including IBM Cloud Virtual Servers, storage, and network settings.

4. Data Backup and Recovery: Implementing data backup procedures and testing recovery processes to ensure data integrity.

5. Failover Testing: Rigorously testing failover mechanisms to validate their effectiveness in maintaining service continuity.

6. Documentation and Training: Creating comprehensive documentation for disaster recovery procedures and training the relevant personnel.

7. Monitoring and Maintenance: Setting up continuous monitoring and periodic maintenance routines to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan.

 Technical Implementation

 The disaster recovery plan includes redundant infrastructure hosted on IBM Cloud Virtual Server.
 Failover mechanisms are implemented to automatically switch to backup systems in the event of a disruption.
 Data backup and recovery processes are designed to minimize data loss and downtime.
 The use of IBM Cloud Virtual Server ensures scalability and reliability for critical services.
